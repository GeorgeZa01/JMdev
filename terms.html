    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Effective date: 21 November 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the services provided by JMdev. By using the website or engaging our services you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>JMdev provides consulting, design, and development services. Descriptions of packages and pricing are indicative and subject to a separate written agreement for custom work.</p>

    <h2>Payment &amp; Fees</h2>
    <p>Any fees or pricing quoted are due as outlined in a signed proposal or invoice.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> A non-refundable 50% deposit is required to secure the project start date. The remaining balance is due upon project completion and prior to final file delivery or website launch.</li>
      <li><strong>Revisions:</strong> All fixed, once-off services include two (2) rounds of minor revisions. Additional revisions will be billed at an hourly rate of R 150.00.</li>
      <li><strong>1-Page Website Plan (R 499 p/m):</strong> This subscription excludes basic hosting, domain connection (client provides domain), and ongoing maintenance.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> All once-off Web Development prices exclude the annual cost of domain registration and monthly/annual web hosting fees. Clients must provide or purchase these separately.</li>
      <li><strong>Refunds &amp; Cancellations:</strong> Refunds and cancellations are subject to the terms in the applicable proposal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, JMdev retains ownership of any pre-existing materials and code. Upon full payment, rights to deliverables created specifically for you will be transferred as agreed in the contract.</p>

    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, JMdev's liability arising from or related to the services is limited to the fees paid for the specific services giving rise to the claim. JMdev is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate the engagement as set out in the governing contract. Termination does not relieve the client of obligations to pay for work completed to date.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time; material changes will be posted with a new effective date.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction where JMdev operates. For specific agreements, the governing law may be defined in the contract.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these Terms can be directed to <a href="mailto:jemaile75@gmail.com">jemaile75@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:0.9rem;color:#94a3b8">These Terms are a concise overview and do not replace a formal contract or legal advice. For high-value engagements, please request a written proposal and contract.</p>
